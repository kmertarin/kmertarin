Here is a young and passionate QA Engineer with a strong focus on delivering high-quality software. Experienced in automated testing using Selenium and Java. I thrive in dynamic and collaborative environments, working closely with development teams to ensure the delivery of robust and reliable software solutions.

My love for computers began at an early age, and I have decided to see computers also in my education life.Now I am currently a Freshman at Jacksonville State University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

My journey in QA engineering has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of test automation frameworks, test design, and defect tracking methodologies. With expertise in Selenium WebDriver, I have effectively automated test cases to improve efficiency and accuracy, enabling faster releases without compromising on quality.

Proficient in Java programming, I utilize my coding skills to write scalable and maintainable test scripts, ensuring comprehensive test coverage across various platforms and browsers. 

Also I have a strong understanding of API testing, employing tools such as Postman and Rest Assured to validate RESTful web services, handle response codes, and perform data validations.

I am committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. I am improving myself on solving complex problems and delivering effective solutions that drive customer satisfaction and enhance overall product quality.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of QA engineering and contribute to delivering exceptional software experiences!
